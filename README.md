# 📡 Network Cable Optimizer

## 📖 Overview
The **Network Cable Optimizer** is a Python-based GUI application that helps optimize network cable layouts between buildings using **Kruskal’s Algorithm**. It provides a **visual representation** of network connections and computes the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** to minimize cable usage while maintaining full connectivity.

## ✨ Features
- 🔌 **Add Network Connections**: Users can input connections between buildings with distances.
- 📊 **Visual Graph Representation**: Displays the current network layout dynamically.
- ⚡ **Find Optimal Layout**: Uses Kruskal's Algorithm to determine the best cabling strategy.
- 🎨 **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using **Tkinter** and **Matplotlib**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🏗️ **Tkinter** (GUI Framework)
- 🔗 **NetworkX** (Graph Algorithms)
- 📉 **Matplotlib** (Graph Visualization)

## 🚀 Installation
To run the project on your local system:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-cable-optimizer.git
cd network-cable-optimizer

# Install dependencies
pip install tkinter networkx matplotlib

# Run the application
python cable_optimizer.py
```

## 🖥️ Usage
1. **Enter building names** and **distance** in the input fields.
2. Click **"Add Connection"** to add a new network connection.
3. Click **"Find Optimal Layout"** to compute the **minimum cable layout**.
4. View the **graphical representation** of the network and optimal cabling.

## 🎯 Benefits
- 💰 **Reduces cable costs** by optimizing network layouts.
- 🏢 **Helps network engineers** plan efficient infrastructure.
- 🔍 **Provides an easy-to-use interface** for visualization.
- 🏆 Uses **Kruskal’s Algorithm**, a well-known method for minimum spanning trees.
